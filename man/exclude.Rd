\item{qc_x}{An integer vector in the range \code{0 - 2} providing quality
control information about \code{x}.}

\item{name_out}{A character string providing \code{varnames} attribute value
of the output.}

\item{win_size}{An integer. Number of \code{x} values displayed per plot.}
}
\value{
An integer vector with attributes \code{"varnames"} and
  \code{"units"}.

\description{
Interactive plots are used for identification and flagging of data for
exclusion based on the visual inspection.
}
\details{
Six options are available during the interactive session. \enumerate{ \item
flag values: select interval of values to exclude or use double-click to flag
single value. \item undo last: allows to change the user flagging input back
to the state before last flagging. \item refresh plots: apply current user
flagging input to the plots. It removes excluded points and affects y-axis
range or it can show again excluded points if option 2 (undo last) was
applied before. \item next plot. \item jump to plot: any plot within the
existing range (see as a plot title) can be selected. \item finalize: finish
the flagging and return the results.}

The interactive session will be finished successfully also when option 4
(next plot) is executed while at the last plot.
